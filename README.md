# Cuboid  
  
This was a website that was set up to support an online game whereby users would have to register and login to the website in order to gain access to the game.  
  
This project was created through Repl.it and was pushed to GitHub as a Repl.it exported zip so it may not work locally. The connection logic is still implemented although there is now a way to bypass needing an account as the database is no longer being hosted by University.
